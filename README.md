Dual-branch Normalizing Flow for Anomaly Detection and Localization from Images


Present a dual-branch architecture to model the density mapping of global and local features, respectively. Our model can achieve coarse-grained and fine-grained image anomaly detection and localization, via modeling both the global features and local texture attributes of the input images with a dual branch normalizing flow. 

# Notes
The codes will be released as soon as we tidy them up.
